## Priorities

### Me

Put a new version of R4DS on CRAN. This will require dealing with a couple of annoying NOTES from R CMD check.

In earlier tutorials, switch to GitHub pages in place of Rpubs? Probably not.

Create a Positron Tutorial. Call it tutorial 30.

Expand AI material in getting help tutorial.

Ensure that any useful material from Quarto R4DS chapter 28 is added to the RStudio and Quarto tutorial.

Add a section to Quarto Websites Introduction tutorial which covers much of the material in Quarto Formats R4DS chapter 29. See below for some info.

Ensure that RStudio and Code and RStudio and Github tutorials link up well together.

Add Exploration Project: Dataset tutorials to primer.tutorials. See discussion below.

Tighten some longer tutorials so that they are more like 60 minutes. See below.

### Mark

Clean up tutorials 02a and 02b.

Clean 04a and 04b.

Clean tutorial 06. I have fixed all the major issues. But please fix remaining typos and other issues.

Clean up 03 and 05.

### Sharav

Tutorial 24

* Find the complaints in Discord and email me the link. #tutorials channel? #general channel?
* Fix the complaints.
* general quality improvements, as with knowledge drops, typos and so on.s

Tutorial 26

* Find the complaints in Discord and email me the link. #tutorials channel? #general channel?
* Fix those complaints.
* Read: https://ppbds.github.io/tutorial.helpers/articles/books.html
* Re-read the chapter. Quality check for entire tutorial.



### Khang

Test Data Visualization tutorial. Fix up any problems. How long does it take?


### Notes from DK

Would be cool to test commands which we expect students to enter into the Console. Of course, written questions don't allow for test chunks, but we can just make our own chunks, with include = FALSE. They will run during tutorial creation and fail if the command no longer works. Of course, in most cases, we would need to create, on the fly, the file which those commands access.

Make more use of https://ggplot2-book.org/ and https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/


The styler package and its use seem important and worth discussing. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_nAfJ-5nkcU&authuser=0 for other interesting options. Note its addition to the new verion of RStudio.


### Graduation Exercises

Upon reflextion, No.

Each tutorial from 5 on should finish with a graduation exercise --- Jade's idea for "Exploration" --- which encourages students to use AI to make something pretty and then put it on the web. Key points:

* Excourage the use of AI extensively.

* Project ends with an image put on the web. Not sure on the best technology for doing so. Quarto website seems like overkill. (Unless we really want to drill, over-and-over again, the repo/project/quarto steps in doing data science projects.) Rpubs seems juvenile. Isn't there a one-line Console command which will do something? Maybe quarto publish quarto-pub quarto-1.qmd? All that requires is that students have a Quarto Pubs account.

* All the resulting URLs are gathered and shared with the class as a whole, with the best results highlighted.

* We specify the data that should be used for the plot, I think. Although we allow advanced students to do more.


## Leftover Material from Chapter 29

Maybe find a home for this stuff?

The most important set of options controls if your code block is executed and what results are inserted in the finished report:

eval: false prevents code from being evaluated. (And obviously if the code is not run, no results will be generated). This is useful for displaying example code, or for disabling a large block of code without commenting each line.

include: false runs the code, but doesn’t show the code or results in the final document. Use this for setup code that you don’t want cluttering your report.

results: hide hides printed output; fig-show: hide hides plots.

error: true causes the render to continue even if code returns an error. This is rarely something you’ll want to include in the final version of your report, but can be very useful if you need to debug exactly what is going on inside your QMD. It’s also useful if you’re teaching R and want to deliberately include an error. The default, error: false causes rendering to fail if there is a single error in the document.

As you work more with knitr, you will discover that some of the default chunk options don’t fit your needs and you want to change them.

When inserting numbers into text, format() is your friend.

Lots more stuff on figures, caching, tables, et cetera.
